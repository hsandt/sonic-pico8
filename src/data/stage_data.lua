    --  so the player can see more of the top and feel that they have reached the (local) bottom of the stage
    -- keypoint X represents the tile i coordinate that camera X must reach (must * tile_size)

    --  from the real stage bottom, that are hidden and from where the camera will be clamped

    --  of a keypoint would reveal suddenly more or less tiles, but we don't mind because the sudden changes
    --  are done when the ground is at a high level, so they can't be experienced when running normally)

      -- usually it's 3 in Sonic 3, but because PICO-8 has a slightly bigger relative screen height,
      --  only 3 would show a sudden 4px clamp when passing tile 384
      -- of course we imitate Sonic 3 but adding tiles descending progressively from much higher than the bottom limit
      --  to hide the sudden change of limit, but while Sonic 3 is fine with 7 tiles, PICO-8 can see up to 8 tiles below (without crouching)
