# Archiving
# The archives we create here keep all the files under a folder with the full game name
#  to avoid extracting files "in the wild". They are meant for manual distribution and preservation.
# itch.io uses a diff system with butler to only upload minimal patches, but surprisingly works well
#  with folder structure changing slightly (renaming containing folder and executable), so don't worry
#  about providing those customized zip archives to butler.
# Note that for OSX, the .app folder is at the same time the app and the top-level element.
